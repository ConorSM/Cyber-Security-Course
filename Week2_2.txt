Virtualisation
	• Definition
		○ Virtualisation is the process of separating a software from the hardware
		○ A virtual server means that the server doesn't exist In a physical form
		○ Hypervisor (aka Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is the interface between VM and host 
			§ OS's need to be separated from the hardware
		○ A VM is just a file
	• Traditionally servers could only be used for a single application
		○ New servers need to be bought for other applications
			§ E.g. web server - Apache, database - MySQL
		○ Servers may have slightly different OS's and hardware
			§ Different configurations, can be complicated
	• Virtual architecture with a Hypervisor allows multiple OS's, each with different Apps
		○ Each OS thinks that it is working on its own hardware

Virtualisation Types
	• Type-1 Hypervisor (Native/Bare-Metal)
		○ Hypervisor runs directly on hardware without any OS
		○ OS's with APP installed on hypervisor 
		○ Security
			§ Hypervisor security
		○ E.g. Xen, Microsoft Hyper V, Vmware ESX/ESXi
	• Type-2 Hypervisor (Hosted
		○ Host machine running under a conventional OS
		○ Hypervisor installed on OS and shares resources with all other apps
		○ Security
			§ Hypervisor security and host's OS security
		○ E.g. Vmware Workstation, Vmware Player, VirtualBox
	• Benefits
		○ Simplicity
			§ Type-2
		○ Performance
			§ Type-1
		○ Security
			§ Type-1
			§ Type 2 has more layers, hence more vulnerabilities
	• OS's installed on Hypervisor are called guest OS's

Linux
	• Architecture
		○ Kernel
			§ Access hardware
		○ Shell
			§ Interface between user applications and Kernel
			§ Ubuntu terminal is BASH AND DASH
			§ Kali is …
		○ Applications
			§ E.g. browser, email ,python, etc
	• Linux Distributions
		○ The different types of linux
			§ Different purposes
				□ have different apps
		○ Main distributions
			§ Debian
				□ Ubuntu and Kali
			§ Fedora
				□ Red Hat and Centos
			§ Arch Linux
				□ Very customizable, but requires experience
	• Filesystem
		○ Control how to store and retrieve the data in/from the storage device
		○ Windows: FAT, FAT32 and NTFS
		○ Linux: EXT4, EXT3, BTRF, XFS
			§ EXT4 is the most used
		○ Windows file systems structure
			§ Starts with letter
		○ Linux
			§ Everything starts at the root
		○ The concept of "Everything is  a File"
		○ Commands and names of files and directories are "Case Sensitive"
		○ Hidden files/directories start with "."
		○ Filesystem tree
			§ Everything starts with a "/"
	• Linux Shell
		○ Text interface to your computer
			§ E.g. command line, terminal, console, prompt, or various other names
		○ Different ways to launch a Linux Terminal
