Cybersecurity Essentials
	• Definition
		○ NIST: The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks
		○ CNSS: 
			§ Prevention of damage to and
			§ The protection of and the restoration of computers, electronic communications systems and services, wire communication and electronic communication
			§ Including information contained therein
			§ To ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation
	• Cybersecurity cube (McCumber Cube)
		○ Framework for establishing and evaluating information security (information assurance) programs
		○ Three dimensions
			§ Desired goals
			§ Data states
			§ Safeguards
	• 1st Dimension: Desired goals (CIA Triad)
		○ Confidentiality
			§ No unauthorised access to data
		○ Integrity
			§ Data should not be modified by any unauthorized party
		○ Availability
			§ Access should not be unavailable
	• 2nd Dimension: Data states
		○ Alice, Bob and Trudy
			§ Alice sends secure message to bob
				□ If Trudy has access, then confidentiality is lost
				□ If Trudy…, then integrity is lost
				□ If Trudy intercepts message and keeps it without sending, then availability is lost
		○ Storage: Data At Rest (DAR)
			§ Stored in memory or on a magnetic tape or disk
		○ Transmission: Data In Transit (DIT)
			§ Transferring data between information systems
		○ Processing: Data In Process
			§ Performing operations on data in order to achieve a desired objective
			§ Data that Is being used
	• 3rd Dimension: Safeguards
		○ Policy and practices: administrative controls, also referred to as operations
		○ Human factors: also referred to as personnel
		○ Technology: software and hardware-based solutions
	• Essential Terms
		○ Asset: an asset is what we're trying to protect
		○ Vulnerability: A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts
		○ Exploit: The way how hackers leverage vulnerabilities
		○ Threat: A threat is what we're trying to protect against - an hypothetical event
		○ Risk: The itersection of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
	• Causes of vulnerability
		○ Design and development errors
		○ Poor system configuration
		○ Human errors
		○ Connectivity
		○ Complexity
		○ Passwords
		○ User Input
		○ Management
		○ Lack of training to staff
		○ Communication
	• Cyber Attacks
		○ UN-targeted cyber attacks
		○ Targeted cyber attacks
	• Cyber Threat Actors
		○ Motivation is important
			§ Nation-States: Geopolitical 
			§ Cybercriminals: Profit
			§ Hacktivists: Ideological
			§ Terrorist Groups: Ideological violence
			§ Thrill-seekers: satisfaction
			§ Insider threats: discontent
		○ Non-motivated actors e.g., natural disasters
	• Cyber Threats
		○ Malware: software that does malicious tasks on a device or network
		○ Spyware: form of malware that hides on a device providing real-time information
		○ Phishing attacks: is when a cybercriminal attempts to lure individuals into providing sensitive data
		○ Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: aim to disrupt a computer network by flooding the network with superfluous requests
		○ Ransomware: type of malware that denies access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid
		○ Zero-day exploit: a flaw that is unknown to the party or parties responsible for patching the flaw
		○ Advanced persistent threats: When an unauthorized user stays in the network for a long time
		○ Trojan: a backdoor in your system
		○ Wiper attacks: malware whose intention is to wipe the hard drive
		○ Intellectual property theft: is stealing or using someone else's intellectual property without permission
		○ Theft of money: gaining access to credit card numbers or bank accounts to steal money
		○ Data manipulation: doesn't steal data but aims to change the data
		○ Data destruction: cyber attacker attempts to delete data
		○ Man-in-the-middle attack: relays and possibly  alters data sent between two people
		○ Drive-by downloads: a download that happens without a person's knowledge
		○ Malvertising: online advertising to spread malware
		○ Rogue software: malware disguised as real software
		○ Unpatched software: known security weakness, but not updated
		○ Data centre disrupted by natural disaster: e.g. flooding
		○ Water holing: Fake website or compromising  legitimate one in order to exploit visiting users
		○ Spear-phishing: sending emails to targeted individuals that could contain attachment with malicious software, or link that downloads malicious software
		○ Deploying a botnet: to deliver a DDOS attack
		○ Subverting the supply chain: attack equipment or software being delivered to the organisation
	• Cyber Threat Surface
		○ All available endpoints that a threat actor may attempt to exploit in Internet-connected devices within the cyber threat environment
			§ The more endpoints, the wider the threat surface in the system
		○ The many processes that produce, deliver, and rely on information systems connected to the Internet are also potential threat vectors and targets.
		○ Services, devices, and data can all be targeted 
		○ Systems that connect to the 
	• Cyber Kill Chain
		○ Steps in order to attack a system
			1. Reconnaissance
				□ harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
			2. Weaponization
				□ Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
			3. Delivery:
				□ Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
			4. Exploitation
				□ Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system
			5. Installation
				□ Installing malware on the asset
			6. Command and Control
				□ Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
				□ Often seen in ransomware
			7. Actions on objectives
				□ With "hands on keyboard" access, intruders accomplish their original goals
		○ "Retreat" is sometimes another step
			§ Delete evidence after the attack e.g. after a nation state attack - don’t want nation to know you were spying on them

Computer Components
	• Hardware
		○ Has firmware that runs the hardware 
			§ e.g. BIOS
	• Software
		○ Everything developed
			§ E.g. OS
	• Humanware
	• All the different types of computers need to be protected
	• Server
		○ A computer that provides a service (hence the name)

Kernal
	• Drivers
	• Hal
	• Hardware


Shared folders
Event viewer
Windows registry (registry editor (search "regedit"))
Environment variables

Windows OS
	• Virtual address spaces
		○ When a processor reads or writes to a memory location, it uses a virtual address, and this is translated to a physical address as part of the read and write process
	• User mode
		○ User-mode applications run in a private virtual address space
		○ Isolated from each other
	• Kernel mode
		○ All code shares a single virtual address space
		○ Not isolated 
		○ If a kernel mode driver accidently writes to wrong virtual address, data belonging to the OS or another driver could be compromised
